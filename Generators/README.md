Key things to note about generators:

        Reading Files: When processing large text files, yield lines instead of loading the entire file.

        Streaming Data: For real-time data processing, where data arrives continuously (like logs or network packets).
        
        Combinatorial Generations: For generating combinations, permutations, or Cartesian products without precomputing them.

Named Tuples:
    Lightweight: They consume less memory compared to DataFrames. Perfect for small datasets.
    
    Immutable: Their immutability ensures data integrity; you can't accidentally modify them.
    
    Easy to Create: Quickly define them without needing to import a large library.
    
    Readability: Named fields make code more readable (like accessing .name instead of [‘name’]).

Pandas DataFrames:
    Powerful: Provide robust, built-in data manipulation and analysis tools.
    
    Flexible: Handle larger datasets more efficiently and support complex operations.
    
    Integrated: Extensive support for data visualization and interfacing with other libraries.
    
    Versatile: Excellent for data cleaning, aggregation, and transformation tasks.

    

Named Tuples: Lightweight and simple; ideal for small, read-only datasets.
    
Pandas DataFrames: Powerful and flexible; ideal for larger, complex datasets requiring extensive manipulation.
